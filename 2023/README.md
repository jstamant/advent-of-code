# Advent of Code 2023

This is my go at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) - my first ever Advent of Code.

For this year, I'm going to use Python to complete these challenges.

I'm choosing it, because I have a bit of experience with it from around ~2011, and I'd like to brush-up on it since learning so much about computing in the past decade. And it's also great with string manipulation, from what I remember - very easy to translate between numbers and characters.

To run the tests, run `pytest` from this directory.
